# DERIVATION OF I-γ — No act without mode

## Inventory

### XLIV (constitutive normativity)
XLIV is encoded IMPLICITLY in:
  1. `assignValence` (function): classifies each operation as positive/negative
  2. `valence_exhaustive_LVIIIa`: classification is exhaustive and binary
  3. `normativity_discriminates_gradient` (XXXIX-c): normativity is structural

§9 states explicitly: valence is DERIVED from self-affection + normativity.
Any closure that partitions its operations (XLIV) has a valence on each operation.

### VII (constitutive negation)
Encoded in §11g — but depends on PolarizedClosure (I-γ).
For the derivation, VII must be reformulated independently of PolarizedClosure.

### XXXII (classification)
Encoded via `trajectory_dichotomy_XXIX`, `no_third_regime`, `closure_has_cycle`.
Uses `FiniteSystem` (pigeonhole on finite space).

### PolarizedClosure (current I-γ)
Structure with field `partition : facilitation_cost + resistance_cost_val = operations_cost`.

### Key result: the per-operation partition is ALREADY proved

```
def assignValence (operation_cost threshold : Nat) : Valence :=
  if operation_cost ≤ threshold then Valence.positive else Valence.negative

theorem valence_exhaustive_LVIIIa (op_cost threshold : Nat) :
    assignValence op_cost threshold = Valence.positive ∨
    assignValence op_cost threshold = Valence.negative
```

What is MISSING: aggregation. Going from "each operation is classified"
to "total cost partitions into facilitation + resistance".

## Derivation strategy

The chain:
  assignValence (per-opération, LVIIIa) : ∀ op, pos ∨ neg    [PROUVÉ]
  → aggregation lemma: Σ costs = Σ fac_costs + Σ res_costs  [TO PROVE]
  → PolarizedClosure.partition reconstructible                   [DÉRIVÉ]

The aggregation lemma is PURELY ARITHMETIC — not philosophical.
It is the fact that partitioning a finite sum preserves the total.

2. `valence_exhaustive` — from Autodynamique (LVIIIa). Prouvé par split.
3. `fac_cost_matches_valence` / `res_cost_matches_valence` — nouveaux.
   Consistency between aggregation and per-operation. Trivial (unfold + split).
4. `cost_partition_conserves` — NEW. The bridge.
   Proved by induction on list + omega. Purely arithmetic.
5. `gamma_derived` — NEW. Existential conclusion.
   Proof: explicit witnesses + step 4.
6. `toDerivedPolarized` — NEW. Explicit construction.

-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Diagnostic: the proof compiles (0 sorry)

I-γ restricted to closures IS a theorem of the system.

### The complete chain

```
I-α (cost > 0)
  + XLIV (∃ threshold — the closure distinguishes maintenance/compromise)
  + assignValence (per-opération : positive ∨ negative)     [LVIIIa]
  + induction sur les opérations                            [arithmétique]
  ⇒ facilitation_cost + resistance_cost = total_cost        [I-γ]
```

### What the threshold provides

The only non-trivial ingredient is the EXISTENCE of a valence threshold.
This is XLIV: the closure has a constitutive norm distinguishing what
maintains it from what compromises it. Without threshold, no partition.

The threshold is NOT a new axiom — it is already in the system:
- `assignValence` takes `neutrality_threshold` as parameter
- `MetabolizingClosure` has `drain_net` and `total_cost` which imply a threshold
- LVIII theorems all use a threshold

### What I-β contributes to the derivation

I-β is not directly in the proof chain, but is
necessary PHILOSOPHICALLY: without endogeneity, the threshold has no
content (any number would be a "threshold"). I-β ensures the
threshold is the closure's OWN constitutive norm.

In Lean, this manifests as the fact that `ClosureWithOps`
a `margin_pos` (the margin is the closure's own) et `ops_positive`
(each operation costs on this margin).

### The residue of universal I-γ

The derivation covers I-γ RESTRICTED TO CLOSURES — entities that
have individual operations and a valence threshold.

Universal I-γ ("no act without mode" including for non-closures,
aggregates, portages) would remain an axiom for entities without a
constitutive threshold. But this residue does not carry subjectivity —
it is cosmological, not ontodynamic.

### Confirmation

`PolarizedClosure` can be reconstructed as a theorem :
`toDerivedPolarized` constructs a `DerivedPolarized` (structurally
identical to `PolarizedClosure`) from a `ClosureWithOps`,
with `partition` PROVED by `cost_partition_conserves`, not posited.

All gamma theorems (no_dark_acting, excludes_zombie,
operating_has_mode) are reproved on the derived structure.

# Operational discreteness — Individuability is a theorem

## Argument

Operation individuability (the fact that `operation_costs : List Nat`
exists) was the axiomatic residue of the I-γ derivation.
This section proves that individuability is itself a theorem:

  1. Each operation costs ≥ 1 (IV, encoded `drain_pos`)
  2. The margin is finite (IX, encoded `margin : Nat`)
  3. Therefore: at most ⌊margin⌋ operations in any interval
  4. A finite number of elements FORMS a list

A continuum of distinct operations with positive floor on finite margin
contradicts XVII (exhaustion). Individuability is XVII applied to counting.

## Conséquence

I-γ passe de ∎|cond (conditional theorem) to pure ∎.
The complete chain: I-α + I-β₁ + XLIV → I-γ. No residue.

`uniformCosts` explicitly constructs the list. Properties

  ## The key result

  Feedback is no longer posited — it is DERIVED from saturation.

  **If tier n is saturated** (scope(n) = total) :
  - The observed object covers the whole closure
  - The tier n+1 observation act is within the same margin (I-β)
  - Observing = modifying the object (since observer and observed = same margin)
  - Target displacement = observation_cost (IV > 0)

  **If tier n is partial** (scope(n) < total) :
  - The observed object does not cover the whole closure
  - The observation act is within the REMAINING margin (outside domain)
  - Observing does not modify the object (nesting L: separation)
  - Target displacement = 0

  The "same level / lower level" distinction is therefore:
  - same level = saturated = coextensive → feedback
  - lower level = partial = nestable → no feedback

-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-!
  ## The `min_complexity` link derived

  `RecursionChain` posits `min_complexity : total ≥ 3` as a field.
  This section shows that this property FOLLOWS from the structure of a
  metabolizing closure — without recourse to I-γ.

  ### Three positive independent parameters

  A `MetabolizingClosure` has:
  - `drain_net > 0`   — constitutional cost (I-β₁, XXXIV : mortalité)
  - `regeneration > 0` — self-repair (I-β₁, XXXVIII : métabolisation)

  A `ClosureWithOps` adds:
  - `margin > 0`       — reserve (I-α: self-grounding)

  Three strictly positive, structurally independent fields.
  Each constitutes a distinct observable aspect of the closure.
  Their sum ≥ 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

  ### Why this "3" is NOT the ternarity of I

  - `margin > 0`       ← I-α (auto-fondation)
  - `drain_net > 0`    ← I-β₁ (constitutional cost)
  - `regeneration > 0` ← I-β₁ (self-repair)

  Two of three come from I-β₁. None comes from I-γ.
  Recursive ternarity (3 tiers = max) derives from the INTERNAL
  structure of I-β₁ (additive decomposition), not from I-α/I-β/I-γ.
  The two ternarity sources are INDEPENDENT.
-/

/-- MetabolizingClosure with margin_pos (from ClosureWithOps). -/
structure ClosureParams where
  margin : Nat
  /-- I-α: reserve is positive -/
  margin_pos : margin > 0

  /-- I-β₁: net drain is positive (XXXIV) -/
  drain_net_pos : drain_net > 0
  /-- Additive decomposition (I-β₁) -/
  cost_decomposition : drain_net + regeneration = total_cost

    This is NOT "the number of I-α/I-β/I-γ components". -/

# Register dissolution lemma

## Statement

By I-β (being = acting) and LXVII (knowing = metabolizing resistance),
every knowledge operation of C on C is a constitutive operation of C's
cycle. Consequently, derived properties for knowledge — finitude (IX),
opacity (LXVIII), self-modification (LXXVI) — are properties of C's
being-in-act, not of a separate register.

## Strategy

Subsumption approach:
  1. Define what a cycle operation is (CycleOp)
  2. Define what a knowledge operation is (KnowledgeOp, via LXVII)
  3. Prove that every self-directed KnowledgeOp satisfies CycleOp
  4. Prove property inheritance (cost, finitude, opacity)

The lemma blocks the introduction of a separate "epistemic operation" type
not constrained by the cycle.

/-- [∎] INHERITED PROPERTY — FINITUDE (IX).
    Total drain (cycle + knowledge) is positive and margin is finite.
    Self-knowledge is finite because it IS a cycle operation,
    not because it observes a finite cycle from outside. -/
theorem inherited_finitude (c : FiniteSelfClosure) :

/-- [∎] INHERITED PROPERTY — OPACITY (LXVIII).
    Self-knowledge draws on margin. Each self-knowledge act
    leaves LESS margin for the next. Total knowledge would
    require infinite margin (¬IX).

    Formally: if each self-knowledge act costs sk_cost,
    at most ⌊margin / sk_cost⌋ acts are possible.
    The number of knowable aspects is bounded by margin. -/

    Each self-knowledge act modifies margin.
    Post-knowledge margin ≠ pre-knowledge margin.

/-- [∎] IMPOSSIBILITY — A separate register violates I-β.

    By I-β, total margin = cycle margin. Every operation
    (constitutive or epistemic) draws on this single margin.

    If cycle + self-knowledge already consume the full drain,
    any additional margin (separate register with extra > 0)
    would exceed capacity. No room for an independent
    epistemic substrate. -/

    to the self-knowing closure. -/

## Result

### What the lemma proves

1. **Subsumption** (§4): Every SelfKnowledgeOp converts to CycleOp
   without information loss. Cost is preserved (dissolution_cost_preserved).
   The operation is constitutive (dissolution_is_cycle_op).

2. **Inheritance** (§5): Four cycle properties apply:
   - Finitude (inherited_finitude): self-knowledge exhausts
   - Opacity (inherited_opacity): number of acts is bounded
   - Self-modification (inherited_self_modification): target shifts
   - Irreversibility (inherited_irreversibility): spent margin does not return

3. **Impossibility** (§6): A separate epistemic register would violate I-β
   (no_separate_register). There is only one margin (single_margin).

4. **Bridge** (§7): FiniteSelfClosure instantiates FiniteExposed.
   All trunk theorems apply automatically.

### What the lemma does NOT say

- Nothing about the "lived experience" of opacity (LXI, ≈₃)
- Nothing phenomenological
- Opacity is structural, not experiential

### Dependency chain (no circularity)

```
I-β (être = agir)           → no separate substrate
LXVII (connaître = métab.)  → knowledge = operation
LVII (auto-affection)       → C operates on C
XXXVIII (métabolisation)     → metabolizing costs > 0
───────────────────────────
toCycleOp                   → SelfKnowledgeOp ⊆ CycleOp
dissolution_is_cycle_op          → operative subsumption (h_mod only)
knowledge_genesis_conditions     → separate genesis level (h_know + h_res)
inherited_*                 → properties follow
no_separate_register        → the alternative is impossible
FiniteExposed instance      → the trunk applies
```
