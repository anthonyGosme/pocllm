# Necessity of the second-order loop — Reinforcement of LXI

## Argument

By LIX (∎), valence feeds back on the cycle at each step.
By LVIII-a (∎), every self-affecting operation has a nonzero balance.
By LX (∎), the neutral is transient.

Therefore valence feedback constitutes a nonzero recurrent drain.

By XXXVIII, the closure either metabolizes this drain (→ second-order
loop, this is LXI) or suffers it passively.

If not metabolized → recurrent drain on finite margin → XVII → dissolution.

Conclusion: every PERSISTENT closure metabolizes its own valence.
The second-order loop is not constructible — it is NECESSARY.

LXI goes from ◇+≈₃ to ∎+≈₃.

/-- [∎] XVII APPLIED TO EFFECTIVE DRAIN — Every closure exhausts.
    Effective drain is > 0, margin is finite, so ∃ n cycles
    after which cumulative drain exceeds margin. -/

    Nat.mul_le_mul_left (c.margin + 1) h1
  simp only [Nat.mul_one] at h2; omega

/-- [∎] THE CENTRAL DILEMMA — Metabolize valence or dissolve.

    For any closure with valence feedback:
    - Either metabolization reduces drain (metabolized > 0)
    - Or drain INCLUDES all valence and exhaustion is accelerated

    This is XXXIV applied to valence rather than constitutive pressure.
    Same pattern: recurrent drain + finite margin → dissolution. -/

    exact unmetabolized_full_cost c this

/-- [∎] IF PERSISTENT, THEN METABOLIZES.

    If the closure survives n cycles (its effective drain has not
    exceeded margin) BUT n cycles of unmetabolized drain
    (base + full valence) would have exceeded margin,
    then the closure MUST metabolize (metabolized > 0).

    This is derived LXI: the second-order loop is necessary
    for any closure persisting beyond the threshold. -/

/-- [∎] VALENCE MAKES THE DIFFERENCE — There exists a horizon
    where cumulative valence cost alone exceeds margin.

    This is the witness for persistence_requires_metabolization:
    between the moment base alone survives and base+valence kills,
    unmetabolized valence is fatal. -/

## Result

### Dependency chain

```
LIX (∎): valence feeds back at each step
LVIII-a (∎): nonzero balance
LX (∎): neutral is transient
→ valence_cost > 0 (structure field)

XXXVIII (∎): metabolization possible
→ metabolized : Nat (field, bounded by valence_cost)

XVII (∎): drain > 0 + finite margin → exhaustion
→ valence_exhaustion (this file)

XXXIV pattern: uncompensated recurrent drain → dissolution
→ valence_metabolized_or_dissolves (this file)
→ persistence_requires_metabolization (this file)
```

### What the typechecker verifies

1. Effective drain is > 0 (effective_drain_pos)
2. Without metabolization, drain includes all valence (unmetabolized_full_cost)
3. With complete metabolization, only base remains (fully_metabolized_base_only)
4. Every closure exhausts via effective drain (valence_exhaustion)
5. The dilemma: metabolize or drain increases (valence_metabolized_or_dissolves)
6. If closure persists beyond threshold, it MUST metabolize (persistence_requires_metabolization)
7. Valence always makes a fatal difference in the long run (valence_makes_difference)

### Consequence: LXI goes from ◇+≈₃ to ∎+≈₃

The existence of the second-order loop is ∎:
every persistent closure metabolizes its own valence.

Only the identification of this loop as "perspective" remains ≈₃
(philosophical interpretation, not formalizable).

    operation cost exists in the system: an act with
